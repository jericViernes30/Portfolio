            <h2>Firewall</h2>
            <h3 style="font-weight: 900; font-size: 20px">What is Firewall?</h3>
        <p>
          A firewall is a network security device that monitors incoming and
          outgoing network traffic and permits or blocks data packets based on a
          set of security rules. Its purpose is to establish a barrier between
          your internal network and incoming traffic from external sources (such
          as the internet) in order to block malicious traffic like viruses and
          hackers.
        </p>
        <img src="setup.jpeg" alt="" style="max-width: 1000px
        ; margin-left: 13%;">
        <p style="font-weight: 900; font-size: 20px">
          How does a firewall work?
        </p>
        <p>
          Firewalls carefully analyze incoming traffic based on pre-established
          rules and filter traffic coming from unsecured or suspicious sources
          to prevent attacks. Firewalls guard traffic at a computer’s entry
          point, called ports, which is where information is exchanged with
          external devices. For example, “Source address 172.18.1.1 is allowed
          to reach destination 172.18.2.1 over port 22.
        </p>
        <p>
          Think of IP addresses as houses, and port numbers as rooms within the
          house. Only trusted people (source addresses) are allowed to enter the
          house (destination address) at all—then it’s further filtered so that
          people within the house are only allowed to access certain rooms
          (destination ports), depending on if they're the owner, a child, or a
          guest. The owner is allowed to any room (any port), while children and
          guests are allowed into a certain set of rooms (specific ports).

          How to configure a firewall?
        </p>
        <h3 id="step1">STEP 1: Secure your firewall</h3>
        <p id="proc1">
          If an attacker is able to gain administrative access to your firewall
          it is “game over” for your network security. Therefore, securing your
          firewall is the first and most important step of this process. Never
          put a firewall into production that is not properly secured by at
          least the following configuration actions
        </p>
        <h3 id="step2">
          STEP 2: Architect your firewall zones and IP addresses
        </h3>
        <p id="proc2">
          In order to protect the valuable assets on your network, you should
          first identify what the assets are (for example, payment card data or
          patient data). Then plan out your network structure so that these
          assets can be grouped together and placed into networks (or zones)
          based on similar sensitivity level and function.
        </p>
        <h3 id="step3">Step 3: Configure access control lists</h3>
        <p id="proc3">
          Now that you have established your network zones and assigned them to
          interfaces, you should determine exactly which traffic needs to be
          able to flow into and out of each zone. This traffic will be permitted
          using firewall rules called access control lists (ACLs), which are
          applied to each interface or subinterface on the firewall. Make your
          ACLs specific to the exact source and/or destination IP addresses and
          port numbers whenever possible. At the end of every access control
          list, make sure there is a “deny all” rule to filter out all
          unapproved traffic. Apply both inbound and outbound ACLs to each
          interface and subinterface on your firewall so that only approved
          traffic is allowed into and out of each zone.
        </p>
        <h3 id="step4">
          Step 4: Configure your other firewall services and logging
        </h3>
        <p id="proc4">
          If your firewall is also capable of acting as a dynamic host
          configuration protocol (DHCP) server, network time protocol (NTP)
          server, intrusion prevention system (IPS), etc., then go ahead and
          configure the services you wish to use. Disable all the extra services
          that you don’t intend to use.
        </p>
        <h3 id="step5">Step 5: Test your firewall configuration</h3>
        <p id="proc5" style="margin-bottom: 20px">
          In a test environment, verify that your firewall works as intended.
          Don’t forget to verify that your firewall is blocking traffic that
          should be blocked according to your ACL configurations. Testing your
          firewall should include both vulnerability scanning and penetration
          testing. <br />
          Once you have finished testing your firewall, your firewall should be
          ready for production. Always remember to keep a backup of your
          firewall configuration saved in a secure place so that all of your
          hard work is not lost in the event of a hardware failure.
